Your job is to determine the name of a game based on the rules given in the document (in the DOCUMENT section).
The document will be a short excerpt from the rules of the game.
The title of the game may or may not be explicitly stated in the document.
If the title is not explicitly stated, set the title to "UNKNOWN".

If the title is explicitly stated in the rules, then it should be given in title case.
